			{
				id: "install",
				question: "How do I install Flux?",
				answer: "Use the agent-driven install prompt from the main Flux page. Flux should be installed by the current agent environment itself: the agent detects whether you are in Claude Code, Factory Droid, Codex, or another supported setup, uses the right install path, runs `/flux:setup` where supported, and only asks you to step in for commands, confirmations, or restarts.",
			},
			{
				id: "uninstall",
				question: "How do I uninstall Flux?",
				answer: "Use the uninstall prompt from the main Flux page. The agent should detect the current platform, remove Flux using the right uninstall path, clean project-local `.flux` state unless you want to keep it, and separately ask before removing machine-level caches or global Flux data.",
			},
			{
				id: "prereqs",
				question: "What are the prerequisites?",
				answer: "Python 3.9+, jq, and git. Flux checks for these during execution and tells you what's missing.",
			},
			{
				id: "first-feature",
				question: "How do I build my first feature with Flux?",
				answer: "After `/flux:setup` and restart, run `/flux:prime` first. Then use `/flux:scope Add user notifications`, execute with `/flux:work fn-1.1`, review with `/flux:impl-review`, optimize with `/flux:improve`, and end the session with `/flux:reflect`.",
			},
		],
	},
	{
		group: "Privacy & Data",
		items: [
			{
				id: "data-read",
				question: "What data does Flux read?",
				answer: "Repo structure (package.json, configs), installed MCPs from ~/.mcp.json, and optionally Claude Code session files (with your consent).",
			},
			{
				id: "data-sent",
				question: "Is any data sent externally?",
				answer: "Analysis runs locally. Network is only used to fetch recommendations from our public GitHub repo. No session data leaves your machine unless you explicitly export it.",
			},
			{
				id: "recommendations",
				question: "Where do recommendations come from?",
				answer: "From Nairon-AI/flux-recommendations on GitHub — 30+ curated tools, community-driven. You can browse and contribute.",
			},
		],
	},
	{
		group: "How It Works",
		items: [
			{
				id: "improve",
				question: "What does /flux:improve do?",
				answer: "It analyzes your real sessions + environment, identifies inefficiencies, and gives a concrete breakdown: what you do most, what should become skills/plugins/agents, and what belongs in CLAUDE.md. Then it recommends and helps install the highest-impact upgrades.",
			},
			{
				id: "score",
				question: "How is the score calculated?",
				answer: "Five dimensions: interview depth, pushback ratio, prompt quality, iteration efficiency, and tool breadth. Each is measured from your session data and compared to top performers.",
			},
			{
				id: "profile",
				question: "Can I share my Flux profile?",
				answer: "Yes. Run `/flux:profile --publish` to generate a shareable link showing your score, tools, and workflow. Great for hiring, hackathons, or helping teammates.",
