// ─── Hire page: FAQ ──────────────────────────────────────────────
export const HIRE_FAQ_ITEMS = [
	{
		question: "How does hiring work?",

			"Pick a tier based on how many engineers you want to hire. Each tier unlocks access to candidates at a different point in the cohort. Higher tiers see talent earlier and get first pick. We handle intros, you run your own process.",
	},
	{
		question: "What kind of engineers will I meet?",
		answer:
			"AI engineers who have shipped agents, RAG systems, fine-tuned models, and launched products to real users in 6 weeks. They have survived 500+ hours of building and weekly cuts. No hand-holding required.",
	},
	{
		question: "What does it cost?",
		answer:
			"Pricing depends on your hiring commitment and tier. There is a partial upfront fee. You pay the rest when you make a hire.",
	},
	{
		question: "What if the hire doesn\u2019t work out?",
		answer:
			"Every hire comes with a 100% success guarantee. If the placement doesn\u2019t work out, we\u2019ll find you a replacement from the next cohort at no additional cost.",
	},
	{
		question: "When do I get access to candidates?",
		answer:
			"Access is tiered: Starter: Meet candidates at Week 8 (demo day). Priority: Access from Week 6. Exclusive: Access from Week 4, with first pick while the cohort is still in full swing.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I submit projects for the cohort to work on?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Priority partners can submit one project brief. Exclusive partners can submit multiple briefs and see how engineers solve your real problems before you hire them.",
	},
	{
		question: "How do I get started?",
		answer:
			"Book a call with us. We will walk you through the cohort, understand your hiring plans, and recommend the tier that fits your needs.",
